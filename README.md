# Spam Detector Notebook

## Overview

This notebook details the process of building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. It explores data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using logistic regression and random forests.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Import spam email data from an external source.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Create models using logistic regression and random forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare the performance of the models and evaluate their accuracy.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data handling.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and metrics.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed or use Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```text
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis and modeling.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook contains features extracted from emails, such as word frequency and capitalization features, classified as either spam or non-spam. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
